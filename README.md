## Overview

![screenshot](Capture3.PNG)
Here are screenshots of how the page looks on three different devices, a cell phone, a tablet and a computer.

- This is a responsive page to be able to show what it could do.

- You can see my demo right <a href="https://chirp-landing-page-codewell-jimaxl.surge.sh">
      here :D
    </a>
- I made this page with the basic things of a frontend developer.

- Use sprites to display the images, which is a large png file that contains all the images displayed on the web page, in order to reduce the loading time for browsers.

- Use Sass (a css framework) so that all browsers can display the page to users, since there are properties in css that not all browsers can process :(
